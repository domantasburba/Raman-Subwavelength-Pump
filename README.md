# Raman Subwavelength Pump

The following software was developed to study topological charge pumping in a subwavelength Raman lattice, described in [arxiv:2210.05515](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05515).

Most important features:
* Time evolution of full model, CRM (coupled Rice-Mele) model and RM (Rice-Mele) models, both in Wannier basis (real space) and Bloch basis (momentum space);
* Calculation of topological invariants (Zak phase, Berry phase and Chern number);
* Calculation of Hamiltonian matrix elements (natural & detuning-induced tunnelings, interactions);
* Construction of Wannier functions for a 1D sinusoidal potential;
* Parameter conversion between full model and CRM model;
